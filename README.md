# noops-mazebot-CPP
A solution for [noopschallenge.com](https://github.com/noops-challenge/mazebot/blob/master/API.md) made entirely in C++
# Information
There are many ways this could be improve (for efficiency or to be more logically organized) that I haven't done. This is because upon running, this solves the entire maze [in around 12 seconds](https://api.noopschallenge.com/mazebot/race/certificate/2q_2paBZMzzp88J2YH8N6oepKGWVyhHh49rHJxZXoyNtrmPO11zZCZgk4gINheRz), which is really all I need from it.
# Improvement
The sorting method used could be made quicker, so basically anything but breadth search
